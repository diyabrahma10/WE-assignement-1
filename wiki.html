            <h1 id="top-level-1" class="collapsible">Name: DIYA BRAHMA </h1>
            <p>My name is Diya Brahma, and I am currently in my 3rd year at the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur (IIESTS), pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Technology. Growing up, I had the opportunity to live in different parts of India due to my fatherâ€™s transferable job in the army. I've attended five schools across various states, which has not only broadened my perspective but also helped me make friends from diverse backgrounds.

                Academically, I maintain a CGPA of 9.14, and I am driven by my passion for learning and my competitive spirit. I constantly seek new challenges to expand my knowledge and skills, both inside and outside the classroom.</p>

                <p>In my first year of college, I was selected for a prestigious scholarship and mentorship program organized by Google in collaboration with TalentSprint. I was among the top 1% selected from over YK applicants across India, which was a remarkable milestone in my academic journey. As part of the program, I traveled alone to Hyderabad for a multi-week bootcamp, where I had the incredible opportunity to visit the Google office.

                    This experience not only allowed me to sharpen my technical skills but also gave me the chance to interact with industry experts and fellow aspiring technologists. It was an unforgettable and empowering experience that strengthened my confidence and inspired my passion for the tech industry.</p>
